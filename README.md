### Non-Functional Goals
1. Help artists set up a digital environment where they can start using the tools and applications pinned to this GitHub account quickly and easily.

### Minimum Functional Goals
1. Install basic environment tools like Brew, Python3, Pip3 and the GitHub command line interface.
2. Install specific Python dependencies like Folium, Pandas and Selenium 
3. Be completely benign and not cause any potential problems on the users computer and it's normal functions

### Stretch Functinoal Goals
1. Add optional tool installations for things like Visual Studio Code.
2. Transition to an executable if possible.
3. Transition all art-related tools and applications to executables if possible and phase out the need for a seperate installer entirely.

This project was built with **Bash** shell script specifically for the other tools and applications pinned to this GitHub profile. It relies heavily on **Brew** and **Pip3** for downloading the packages and libraries needed for these projects to function.

This was originally developed as half-day project by [Tom Betthauser](http://www.tombetthauser.com/) in 2020.
